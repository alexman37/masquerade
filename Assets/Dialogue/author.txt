/BLOCK=s_opt2
	A():I'm sure you already knew, but most of these characters are dry as parchment paper.
	A():But I enjoy my conversations with you.
	A():Once in a while, you actually surprise me.
	A():So what shall we discuss?

/BLOCK=s1_truth
	A():Well, I suppose you're the first one I'm telling this to.
	A():It's a farewell event for me.
	A():I'll be leaving the country soon. No idea when I'll come back.
	A():Don't tell the Duke.
	A():Not every relationship needs a tear-filled goodbye.
	A():Sometimes, it's better to end these things as soon as you can.

/BLOCK=s2_tale
	A():I'm joining the Duke in celebration of his newfound wealth.
	A():...by helping him spend it on wine.

/BLOCK=opt2
	A():Hm. If only.
	A():This party's been quite the bore thus far. More so, now that nearly everyone left.

/BLOCK=opt4
	A():*sigh*
	A():I'm sure you've heard rumors of it all.
	A():So allow me to clear the record.
	A():Your father and I were best of friends for decades.
	A():Of all things, it's money that's breaking us apart...how foolish is that?
	A():In return for publishing my books, he takes more than his fair share of the cut.
	A():I've informed him about it. Many times.
	A():I'll always respect him as a friend. But as a business partner...
	A():I'm ready to cut ties and be done with it.

/BLOCK=opt5
	A():It's alright.
	A():Sometimes a fresh start is the best medicine.
	A():And besides...I'm working on a new mystery right now.
	A():I promise, you'll be the first to know when it's finished.
