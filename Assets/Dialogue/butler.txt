## THE BUTLER (Clyde Carstairs)




# First time meeting character
/BLOCK=start
	B():Ah, you're back, sir.
	B():I trust you're feeling better now? I was quite concerned for you.
	
	/CHOICE
		s_opt1:What happened to me?
		s_opt2:I'm feeling fine
	/ENDCHOICE
/ENDBLOCK



/BLOCK=s_opt1
	B():I wish I knew, sir.
	B():I'm told you started feeling lightheaded and simply collapsed.
	B():A bad drink, perhaps. Or a chef who'll soon be unemployed?
	B():Whatever the case, I'm grateful for your recovery.
	N():(A bad drink? Could it be, that someone...)
	
	/GOTO=main
/ENDBLOCK

/BLOCK=s_opt2
	B():Most excellent, sir.
	B():The night is still young. May we enjoy it in peace.
		
	/GOTO=main

# Every time after the first
/BLOCK=second
	B():Yes, sir?
	
	/GOTO=main
/ENDBLOCK



/BLOCK=main
	/CHOICE
		opt1:Seen anything suspicious?
		opt2(sus):What was in my drink?
		opt3(sus):Is anyone acting strange?
		opt4:Goodbye
	/ENDCHOICE
/ENDBLOCK



/BLOCK=opt1
	B():Suspicious, sir?
	B():No, I haven't seen anything much out of the ordinary.
	B():Well, aside from your fall, that is.
	B():Do you...believe something strange has occurred?
		
	/CHOICE
		s1_yes:Possibly
		s1_no:No, never mind
	/ENDCHOICE
/ENDBLOCK


/BLOCK=s1_yes
	B():Oh, dear. I admit, sir, I had no idea.
	B():I'll keep an eye out and let you know if I see anything unusual, alright?
	B():Ah, on that note- where'd you get that notebook?
	N():Oh. It's nothing.
		
	/FLAG sus
	/GOTO=main
/ENDBLOCK



/BLOCK=s1_no
	B():Ah. Perhaps you're still a bit nauseous.
	B():Hopefully you feel better soon.
		
	/GOTO=main
/ENDBLOCK






/BLOCK=opt2
	B():Red wine, sir. The finest in all the land, I might add!
	B():I could bring you some more, if you like.
	N():No thanks. I've had enough.
	B():As you wish, sir. A smart man always knows his limits.
	
	/GOTO=main
/ENDBLOCK




/BLOCK=opt3
	B():Pardon me, sir, but it's rude for a butler to gossip about his benefactors.
	B():However...since you are also my benefactor...
	B():Miss Wells appears to be on edge about something...though I admit, I am just speculating.
	B():And Charles is being his usual, unusual self.
	B():That's all I can say. I pray you won't tell anyone of my rude remarks?
	
	/GOTO=main
/ENDBLOCK




/BLOCK=opt4
	B():I'll be here if you need me, sir.
